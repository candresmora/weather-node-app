<h2>Weather console app using Node.js</h2>

This is a weather console app made using Node.js.

The app will ask the user to enter a city and the console-app will show the user a list of cities with their country, and the user will be able to select the city he/she is looking for.

The app uses the GeoLocation and OpenWeatherMaps API's to be able to obtain the location and the weather information.

<h3>API's used:</h3>

For this project I'll use a geo location API, in this case I am using the MapBox API, this is a great service for what I am doing, give it a try if you are interested in making some personal projects with geo location. There's also the need of a service to get the weather according to the information I got from the MapBox API, in this case I will use the OpenWeather API.
